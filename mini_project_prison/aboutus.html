      <p>The history of Jails department in Kerala begins with the formation of the State in 1956. Jails existed in Travancore - Cochin State and British Malabar State were reorganized and formed the Jail department. The first administration report of the Jails of Travancore state for 1862 and 1863 published during the period of Dewan Sir. T. Madhava Rao. According to this report there were the Principal Jail at Trivandrum (Fort) and the Divisional Jails at Quilon and Alleppey besides the Sub Jails attached to the District or Zilla Courts. The Principal Jail at Fort which was housed in the old barracks of Nair Brigade, established in 1861 upgraded to the status of Central Jail in 1873. This Jail was shifted to the present site at Poojappura in 1886. Industrial activities were started in the Central Prison in the same year by then Dewan Sir. T. Ramarao. Subsequently reforms intended to improve the condition of convicts were also introduced. In 1890, the ruler of the state sanctioned money grant to destitute prisoners during their release to enable them to reach homes. A separate block was constructed in Central Prison for female prisoners in 1904. Medical administration of the convicts was placed under the State Chief Medical Officer.

        In Cochin, the Jails of improved type were started, along with the establishment of Zilla Courts, the Judges thereof exercising the control of these Jails. There were 2 Jails, one at Ernakulam and other at Trichur, besides a small Jail at Tripunithura, forming part of the Ernakulam Jail. In 1890 a Central Jail was established at Ernakulam and in order to improve the Jail administration, Mr. Robinson, a European Police Officer from British service was appointed as Superintendent in 1892. This Jail was shifted to Viyyur in 1914. Besides the Central Jail at Viyyur, there were 7 Sub Jails in Cochin, under trial prisoners and with one month and below were detained. All prisoners were kept in fetters throughout the period of the imprisonment. There was no remunerative industry of any kind. Convicts of Travancore and Cochin region were employed in extramural work such as sweeping and cleaning of public roads and public offices, palaces and the construction of roads. The Jails were then guarded by a detachment of British sepoys settled at Ernakulam and Trichur.
